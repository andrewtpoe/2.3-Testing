Testing for ATM code from project 1.4-ATM-Classes

The tests.rb file has a significant amount of testing for the other classes in the project folder. This program was not built with TDD, testing was added later. Future projects will likely be built with at least some influence from TDD, or in partnership with TDD techniques.
